# What is this?

This is a demonstration of how to create a simple python package that can be installed from a git repository using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

To install run:

```
poetry add git+https://github.com/tnez/python-package-hello-world.git#0.0.1
```

Or using `SSH` instead:

```
poetry add git+ssh://git@github.com:tnez/python-package-hello-world.git#0.0.1
```
